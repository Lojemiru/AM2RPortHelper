# AM2RPortHelper
A simple tool to make porting Windows builds of AM2R-Mods to other platforms easier. This will *only* work with VM-mods of the Community Updates, not of the original 1.1.  
You need to have at least .NET Core 5 installed.
 
## How do I use this?
Simply compress your mod as a zip, and then drag-n-drop it into this tool. After that, select if you want to have a port made for Linux or Android. A zip/apk that can be used for the [AM2RModPacker]() will then be created into the directory next to the program.
